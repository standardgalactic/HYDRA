Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise

Abstract
TARTAN (Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise) is a
novel framework for encoding spatial, physical, and semantic metadata into
the visual substrate of dynamic scenes. By integrating recursive tiling, Gaus-
sian aura beacons, pixel-stretched worldline encoding, annotated noise fields,
and holographic tartan overlays, TARTAN transforms each frame into a self-
contained ledger of a scene's evolution. Unlike conventional generative mod-
els, which rely on brute-force computation and lack cognitive grounding,
TARTAN embeds causal and intentional truths, enabling physics-aware re-
construction and semantic transparency. Applications span computer vi-
sion, sustainable design, and visual storytelling, offering a robust antidote
to epistemic opacity in digital systems.

Introduction
Modern generative models, such as transformer-based large language models
(LLMs) and IBM Watson, achieve competence through computational scale but
lack alignment with biological cognition. Their reliance on arbitrary architectures—
handcrafted scorers in Watson, multi-head attention in transformers—produces
epistemically brittle outputs that fail to capture the embodied, predictive nature
of human reasoning. TARTAN addresses this gap by encoding a scene's spatial,
temporal, and intentional dynamics into its pixel space, creating frames that are
simultaneously visual artifacts and reconstructable ledgers.

Critique of Brute-Force Architectures
2.1
Limitations of Watson and Transformers
IBM Watson employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of over 1,000 handcrafted
scorers, while transformers leverage dense matrix operations across billions of
parameters. Neither resembles the sparse, energy-efficient networks of biologi-
cal cognition, which integrate astrocytes and neurons for predictive processing
[2, 4]. Key limitations include:
1

• Architectural Arbitrariness: Watson's scorers and transformers' atten-
tion mechanisms are engineering conveniences, not neurobiological prin-
ciples. No organism uses backpropagation or softmax attention [7].
• Epistemic Mismatch: Both systems lack sensorimotor grounding, relying
on disembodied token processing rather than embodied feedback loops [5,
8].
• Functional Myopia: Watson aligns tokens via heuristic scoring, while trans-
formers minimize cross-entropy, leading to hallucinations and brittleness
[1, 6].
• Cognitive Inefficiency: Biological systems compress knowledge via pre-
dictive coding, while Watson and transformers enumerate candidates or
parameters [3, 8].

Toward Cognitively Natural Systems
Future AI must embrace active inference, predictive coding, and symbol ground-
ing to align with evolutionary principles [3, 5, 7]. TARTAN embodies these ide-
als by encoding causal substrates—physics, intent, and semantics—into visual
frames, offering a transparent, biologically plausible alternative.

Core Principles
TARTAN posits that every actor and event in a scene should be represented as
a field-emitting entity, with its history, behavior, and trajectory embedded in
the visual substrate. This ensures that each frame is a multidimensional record,
capable of being read visually, verified steganographically, reconstructed algo-
rithmically, and interpreted semantically.

Technical Framework
4.1
Recursive Tiling
Scenes are partitioned into hierarchical tiles (e.g., quadtrees or concentric bands),
each encoding layered attributes such as color, texture, motion vectors, and se-
mantic labels.
This multi-resolution structure prioritizes detail based on dy-
namic complexity or narrative significance.
4.2
Gaussian Aura Beacons
Each actor emits a Gaussian field, or aura-beacon, radiating attributes including:
• Temperature: Thermodynamic state or emotional tone.
• Density: Material concentration or attention weight.
2

• Velocity Vector: Speed and direction.
• Trajectory: Predicted path or intent.
These fields overlap and interfere, forming a soft signal network that captures
the scene's physical-psychological atmosphere.
4.3
Pixel Stretching and Worldline Encoding
Motion is encoded by stretching pixels along an actor's worldline, embedding:
• Direction: Path taken.
• Length: Speed.
• Curvature: Acceleration or turning.
• Color/Opacity: State changes (e.g., fading heat).
This transforms each frame into a 4D imprint, warping time into the spatial do-
main.
4.4
Annotated Noise Fields
Structured noise is injected as a semantic carrier wave, encoding:
• Hidden metadata (via steganography).
• Scene class priors.
• Temporal uncertainty.
• Narrative role cues (e.g., protagonist, obstacle).
This ensures that every pixel is probabilistically expressive.
4.5
Holographic Tartan Overlay
A grid-based tartan pattern, either visible or steganographic, embeds compressed
representations of scene layout, object relationships, material origins, and sym-
bolic metadata. Each stripe or square may contain a recursive snapshot of the
whole, enabling holographic reconstruction.
5
Generative Reconstruction
Diffusion models trained on TARTAN-encoded data reconstruct scenes with physics-
aware, intention-consistent outputs. By leveraging embedded worldlines and
aura fields, these models denoise truth rather than hallucinate textures, enabling
applications in video synthesis, forensic analysis, and interactive storytelling.

Applications
• Computer Vision: Enhanced scene understanding for autonomous sys-
tems.
• Sustainable Design: Transparent material provenance via tartan-encoded
packaging.
• Visual Storytelling: Dynamic overlays for narrative-driven cinema or gam-
ing.

Discussion
TARTAN's commitment to semantic transparency challenges the epistemic opac-
ity of brute-force systems like Watson and transformers. By encoding causal
substrates, it offers a framework for verifiable digital artifacts. Challenges in-
clude computational overhead and the need for standardized decoding proto-
cols, which future work will address.

Conclusion
TARTAN reimagines visual encoding as a tapestry of truth, where pixels are threads,
auras are dyes, and tartan grids are weaves of meaning. By aligning with bio-
logically plausible principles—predictive coding, symbol grounding, and active
inference—it transcends the limitations of current AI, paving the way for trans-
parent, accountable digital systems.
